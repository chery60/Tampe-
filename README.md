and the last feature is --("i dontn't know its possible or not")-- its a interface where a group of persons can join in a conversation where that persons have a choice of being connected in either audio or video call. i.e in the conversation some will be in audio call and some will be in video call.

another feature is making of partial groups which last for small time for example in india girls chat a alot with different persons at a time so for them creation of partial group which lasts for some time will be a nice feature.
